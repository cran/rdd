\title{Plot of the Regression Discontinuity}
\usage{
  \method{plot}{RD} (x, gran = 400, bins = 100, which = 1,
    range, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{\code{rd} object, typically the result of
  \code{\link{RDestimate}}}

  \item{gran}{the granularity of the plot. This specifies
  the number of points to either side of the cutpoint for
  which the estimate is calculated.}

  \item{bins}{if the dependent variable is binary, include
  the number of bins within which to average}

  \item{which}{identifies which of the available plots to
  display. For a sharp design, the only possibility is
  \code{1}, the plot of the running variable against the
  outcome variable. For a fuzzy design, an additional plot,
  \code{2}, may also be displayed, showing the relationship
  between the running variable and the treatment variable.
  Both plots may be displayed with \code{which=c(1,2)}.}

  \item{range}{the range of values of the running variable
  for which to plot. This should be a vector of length two
  of the format \code{c(min,max)}. To plot from the minimum
  to the maximum value, simply enter
  \code{c("min","max")}.}

  \item{...}{unused}
}
\description{
  Plot the relationship between the running variable and
  the outcome
}
\details{
  It is important to note that this function will only plot
  the discontinuity using the bandwidth which is first in
  the vector of bandwidths passed to \code{RDestimate}
